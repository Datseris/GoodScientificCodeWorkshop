This workshop is all about documentation. It's one of the most important aspects of code and software: it makes your code accessible to others, makes their experience with it pleasant, makes them wanna keep using it for the long run, and lowers the threshold for them to become contributors! Whether you are a maintainer of several registered Julia packages, or a just someone with an unregistered codebase that you believe can be useful for others, this workshop will be of use to you!

The workshop will be fully hands-on, and will be composed by several iterations of [lecture -> application] for the covered topics. The main things it will cover are (among others, and depending on the real-time flow):

1. Core principles of what makes a good documentation.
1. The skeleton of a good documentation: exceptional, unambiguous docstrings.
1. The different depths of exposition approach to documentation.
1. The introductory tutorial.
