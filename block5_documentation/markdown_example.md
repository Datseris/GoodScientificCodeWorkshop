# Markdown example
Markdown is a way to style text by using plain text.
It was created by John Gruber in 2004. It is widely used on the web and is the best tool for creating documentation ðŸ˜„

## Basics
Headers denote sections. They are text prefaced with one to six `#` and then an empty space.

- Markdown can do lists like the one you read now with `-`
- Make text **bold** or *italic*, and can even do [links](www.google.com)

1. Numbered lists, like the one you read now.
2. Tables, in-line `code`, code blocks, horizontal lines, and many more!
3. See https://www.markdownguide.org/ for more!

Here is a code block with Julia highlighting:
```julia
rand()
x = 1 + 1
```

This text is already highlighted in my VSCode editor!
